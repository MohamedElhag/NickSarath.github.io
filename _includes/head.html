Fuck, its 1:00 in the morning and I’m feeling like shit. I completely forgot about dinner, and I still need to take a shower. I have the Nirviral source code opened on on my desktop and Im starting to lose interest on it. On my other monitor I have skype opened up, I have like 50 contacts on skype, but I like devoting my time to one person in particular. Lynn L***, yes thats her name. Dont worry about her last name if you are reading this. She’s half French and half Viet, and holy shit she’s fucking gorgeous. Im chatting with her right now as Im typing this, we’re currently talking about guys that she likes. She even has this thing that she made up called the ‘bae list’. I think its more of a friends list than a bae list, I mean Im on it so thats kind of why I think its a friends list than a bae list. The list is ordered by numerically, so theres a #1 and a #2 and so on. I dont really know where the number stops, but I am actually on the list. I remembered it was a late October night and I was talking to her on skype and we were just talking about our baes or people we considered to be our baes, and then she told me that I was bae #20 on her list. I was fucking devastated, but I was just happy to be on the list. I later then got promoted to bae #10 for some stupid thing I did that I thinked she might have liked. You know to completely be fucking honest, I’ve never been this so fucking close to one girl ever. She’s really the only girl I talk to on a daily basis. She told me that Im a really good friend. If I had to choose between a million dollars or being with her for the rest of my life then I would most definitely go with door number fucking 2. Shes the only girl that got me feeling this way. But there’s so many fucking obstacles keeping us from being together. Plus she told me that she already likes someone. If I had one wish it would just to make her smile everytime Im around her. 



I need to do something to get my mind off her, easy enough I just need an idea. Its 1:30 in the morning now and Im fucking devastated. Lynn just logged off so I dont really have anyone to talk to. I’ve always wanted to build something, but not just anything. Ive always wanted to build something that was meaningful and would turn into something that millions of people would use. Im working on something thats probably going to get me there one day, but by the ways things are looking Im not so sure when that day will come.


free movies, who doesnt want to watch free movies? thats what i’ll fucking do make a site that lets people stream high quality movies for free. Get fucking known for it and get shit rich. Hah in my dreams.
